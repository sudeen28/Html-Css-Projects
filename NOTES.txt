i embarked ona journey to build 10 html & css projects
which as i'm writing this notes i,ve completed one and embarking on almost done wuth the second one 
--------------------wat i learnt so far---------


------TOP PROPERTY----
i stumbled on some new css property which includes::
the [Top property] and the position absolute and relative

the top property allows you to move an element downwards more like the margin tools ecxept the top property doesnt create a new space


--------FILTER PROPERTY--------------------------------
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BLUR ADD EFFECT TO A BACKGROUND EFFECT LIKE BLUR,GREYSCALE AND THE LIKES

-------------POSITION RELATIVE & POSITION ABSOLUTE-------







----------TRANSFORM & TRANSLATE PROPERTY--------------
